# How I Blog Daily As An iOS Software Developer
## I'm doing this during early mornings

Writing daily on this blog has been a great move for me. But not financially.
People hear me say this, and are surprised.
Colleagues have seen my work on Medium, and tried to start their own and stopped after an article or two.
Yet each day I manage to write something and keep motivated. I keep working and writing even when it seems that it doesn't make sense to do so.
# Here's why
## I want to be a better developer
At the core of my work is a want. A want to be a better developer. Rather than procrastinate about what App I could or should make, I like to write articles. This gives me a library of "how to" articles that I can refer to.
Not only that, I've written them in a style I can easily understand. My own style
## Communication
I'm developing my written communication skills. I can type faster than ever (although that is a side-benefit), but also with more clarity.
I love people getting in touch through the comments, Twitter or that YouTube channel that didn't work for me. Questions help me keep motivated, nice comments make me feel good and criticism at least makes me think. It's all important and interesting stuff.
## Technical skills
I'm not someone who finds it easy to sit down and watch a video or follow a tutorial on the Internet without having a reason to do so. I did have concerns that my technical skills would atrophy. To keep myself up to date, I like to write blog posts. They keep me pushing forwards, and keep my skills improving.
## Feedback
I've worked jobs where feedback is difficult to get (that time in a performance review where the manager didn't even read my objectives sticks out) and getting anything as a software developer can be difficult.
Writing a blog means I get more eyes on my code and ideas. It helps me improve even if that improvement is simply writing better blog posts (but I feel that these posts give much more than that).
## Discipline
Everyone finds working difficult sometimes. Moreso when that work is for self-improvement. Sitting down each morning to work on blogging builds my routine and reminds me that I need to keep working. I know this doesn't work for everyone, but it works for me.
# Here's How
## Start today
I started blogging before I could get a steady job as a software developer. In fact, I started publishing when working a full-time job and studying for a Masters and learning the basics of iOS development.
I just started because I knew it was a good thing to do. Working in lunch-breaks and at 6am to get the time. I knew it was something I wanted to do even if nobody read my work.
Publish, publish, publish. If you show up, you'll get better.
The best time to start? Today.
## Ignore the money
If I wanted to write articles for money I think I'd set up an account about motivation and self-help. Technical tutorials and blogs don't get great traction on Medium and if I count the money I'm getting >$1 an hour.
I'm not doing this for income. I'm doing it in order to improve myself and give something back to anyone who wants to look at my work. If anyone wants to read my technical articles for free they're all on GitHub, and I maintained giving articles for free even when times were really hard for me. If I wanted to make money, I'd do something else. I want to code.
## Ignore the noise
Sometimes I do get negative comments. You've written this article, why isn't it another unrelated article? You've made a typo (sometimes it's not a typo at all but a British English spelling), why are you such an MVVM pushing idiot (my favourite insult).
It doesn't matter. If nobody reads my articles I'd still be making them for myself.
## Remember "The Mission"
I do sometimes think about making my articles private as it does take time to republish them for public consumption. When you spend some hours creating good quality images and explaining a topic only for it to generate 50c (and a negative comment) it does make me wonder if I should keep doing it.
Then I remember. It's about helping people out and spreading knowledge. If I keep this stuff to myself, what is the point in the end?
Sure, I do find it motivating to see some subscribers to Medium or that time one person bought me a coffee. It doesn't amount to an income though and the fact I'm not pursuing this work for monetary gain means I'm free to write, learn and educate about any topic I wish.
That's liberating in a sense.

# Conclusion
Writing daily means I've published 600+ articles so far. There's more to come, and I hope you've got some value out of this particular post.
As I said, I love hearing from any readers so if you want to leave a comment that would be great.
