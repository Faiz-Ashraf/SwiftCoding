# Agile Vs. Scrum (AKA Agile != Scrum)
## Not the same, Dave.

Scrum and Agile are often confused and mixed up by (otherwise capable) developers. 

This can't go on! We need to think about ways that we can develop software to deliver that working product.

# Agile
## The basics: an iterative approach
Agile software development is about creating an incremental, iterative approach to software development where the goal of each iteration is to create a working product.

## The manifesto
There are a set of [basic rules, known as the Agile Manifesto.](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fagilemanifesto.org)

There are 12 principles of Agile software development:

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## What Agile DOESN'T tell you
Agile is the framework that utilizes a core set of values and principles - and that means that it isn't specific about how a particular product can or should be managed. In order to actually implement an Agile framework in your team, you're going to need to have a process that implements that incremental, iterative approach.

## What an Agile method can tell you
An Agile method can help leadership to combine business stakeholders and developers in order to align their product with customer needs and company goals.

Agile refers to any process which aligns to the principles of the Agile Manifesto and Scrum does just that: aligning to the 4 values and 12 principles given.

## Scrum
Scrum helps teams to tackle complex problems, with the overarching idea that it is simple to implement.

Scrum leaves the teams in a organisation, and puts responsibility and respect for team members at the forefront of the problem solving process.

# The framework
Scrum enables teams to deliver batches of functionality that stakeholders and see and inspect at the end of each sprint. Each Sprint should produce a release candidate, and scrum teams can adapt their plans based on their performance at any given point in time.

The idea is that working software is delivered in chunks of (perhaps) two weeks where each of these two week sprints deliver potentially releasable work.

## Values
* Respect
* Courage
* Focus
* Commitment
* Openness

By embodying these values, Scrum is both iterative and incremental. By providing transparency to both the development team and the stakeholders of the progress of the software. This also leads to adaptation and the advantage of learning from both good experiences and past mistakes.

## Key roles
In Scrum there are three roles:
* Scrum Master
* Product Owner
* Development Team

The *Scrum Master* is the facilitator in the group, and helps the team to achieve business value. This is a discrete role from being a manager of team member or leading the project; that is the Scrum Master serves the team and removes roadblocks and helps the team to adopt Agile development practices.

The *Product Owner* owns the product backlog, and prioritises the work that needs to be completed in the software project as well as representing the customer. In readiness for the upcoming Sprint, the Product Owner continually re-prioritizes and refines the product backlog.

The *Development Team* completes the work required to create a Sprint Goal, and is typically cross-functional and has the necessary expertise to deliver the completed product.

## Artefacts
The *product backlog* is a prioritized list of everything that needs to go into the product for it to be completed. This is never complete, and the product owner needs to constantly work on this document.

The *sprint backlog* is a list of everything that the development team commits to achieve in a sprint. Only the development team can add to the backlog, and removing items requires negotiation with the product owner (and this negotiation is often slicing an item into smaller parts rather than simply dropping the implementation of the same).

The *releasable product increment* is the artefact created at the end of a sprint that is potentially releasable. This requires having an agreed-upon definition of done (usually including what tested means for the solution).

The Scrum team develops a *sprint goal* as a high-level summary of which should be achieved in a sprint. This:
* Supports Prioritisation
* Creates focus
* Enables feedback to be obtained, and makes it easier to analyse the same
* Supports stakeholder communication

## Ceremonies
**Sprint Backlog Refinement **- The backlog is continually refined by the product owner and the development team.

**Sprint Planning Meeting **- Answers the question "What are we going to work on" in collaboration between the product owner and development team

**Daily Stand-up Meeting **- The classic daily stand-up meeting that often starts the day for software developers!

**Sprint Review Meeting **- Held at the end of a sprint to demonstrate the newly built functionality. Gets feedback from the stakeholders and product owner about the software artefact. 

**Sprint Retrospective Meeting **- Retrospective meetings focus on what went well, and what needs to be improved. Conforms to the idea of that improvement is a continuous cycle.

## Measurement
Velocity is used to measure the rate at which scrum development teams deliver business value. To calculate velocity, add up the estimates of the features, user stories and backlog items successfully delivered in a sprint. Points from partially-completed or incomplete stories should not be counted in calculating velocity.

Many Scrum teams use a **burndown** chart to measure and display how much work is remaining in a sprint and provides an early warning that perhaps things are not going as well as they might do.

# Why use Scrum?
* There are a myriad of advantages to using Scrum in any given project
* Increased ability to manage changing priorities
* Better visibility into projects
* More alignment between business and IT
* Faster time to market

Which is probably why it is the de-facto choice for many software development houses.

# Conclusion
Agile simply isn't Scrum. This is a mistake many developers have made over the years, and I hope this article helps you in clarifying the difference between both Agile and Scrum. Hope!
